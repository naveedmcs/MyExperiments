#36 Property observers, getter/setter and lazy are mutually exclusive

Little thing that surprisingly became a discovery for me, because it's rare case in practice, so I'm not ashamed of it ðŸ¤£. Property observers, getter/setter and lazy cant be used together, they are mutually exclusive. So you should choose what pattern makes most profit to you in particaulr situation.
